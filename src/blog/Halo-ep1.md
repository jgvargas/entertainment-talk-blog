Wow, what an episode. Master Chief is finally in the big screen. 343 has decided that in order to expand the Halo brand that this show will be in a alternate timeline, dubbed the "Silver timeline". I personally think that seperating the cannon between the two mediums is a good choice as it gives the show-runners a bit more room to be creative. That is probably an incediary statement on my part given the online fan reception to the series but I feel like we can have our Halo video game cannon and also have this other version too.

Now, episode 1 really gave us a treat with Silver Team, Master Chief's team comprised of Vannak-134 Riz-028 Kai-125, really kickin' ass! There was even a cool helment display view that was cool.
